## Guidance for Code Generation

- Scripts are written in JavaScript (ESM) and use Node.js
- Do not use any extra dependencies, unless abslutely necessary: in that case ask the user first for approval
- A script is a single file, and must not be split into multiple files

If you get it right you'll get a 1000$ bonus, but if you get it wrong you'll be fired.
