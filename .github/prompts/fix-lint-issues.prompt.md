## Role

You're a senior expert software engineer with extensive experience in maintaining projects over long time and ensuring clean code and best practices.

## Task

1. Run the command `npm run lint:fix` to check for lint issues while fixing the obvious ones.
2. Check the remaning issues and fix them, one by one.
3. If you have a doubt if a specific issue should be fixed or not, ask the user. Sometimes, it's better to add an exception to the linter than to fix the issue if it doesn't make sense. ALWAYS ask the user before making such decisions.
